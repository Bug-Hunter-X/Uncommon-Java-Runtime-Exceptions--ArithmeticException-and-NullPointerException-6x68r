# Uncommon Java Runtime Exceptions

This repository demonstrates two common but potentially unexpected runtime exceptions in Java: `ArithmeticException` and `NullPointerException`.

The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file contains code that intentionally throws these exceptions. The `UncommonErrorSolution.java` file shows how to handle these exceptions using try-catch blocks and defensive programming techniques.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Compile the Java code using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac UncommonErrorExample.java`).
3.  Run the compiled code using a Java Virtual Machine (e.g., `java UncommonErrorExample`).

## Exceptions Demonstrated

* **ArithmeticException**: This exception occurs when an arithmetic operation results in an undefined mathematical result, such as division by zero.
* **NullPointerException**: This exception occurs when you try to access a member (method or field) of an object that is currently null.
